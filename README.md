This is the worlds best shell. Fast, lean, and with non of that other fluff you don't want. In fact this shell specializes in doing ls, pwd, cd, grep, and executing programs! You don't have to worry about pipes because guess what? This shell can't do that! There is psuedocode for pipes though in case you wanna read how I would do pipes. But there is ample error checks and the shell does fork properly. 

I make the following assumptions:

You don't input a command more than 100 characters

I assume that you input the correct number of arguements for each command, but if you input too many arguements the shell does not crash and runs fine. It just does not tell you there are too many arguements.

To run the worlds best shell you, The Landy Shell, you must do the following:

1) cd into the build  directory
2) Buy me a beer
3) run cmake ..
4) run make
5) buy me another beer
6) take six shots to ignore the warnings
7) run ./shell
8) marvel at the perfection in front of you
